### Hello!

**I'm looking for a friendly, solid front-end developer to help me with some small projects now, with the potential of joining me on larger projects later.**

These projects involve creating and implementing [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) and [LemonStand](http://lemonstand.com) themes out of existing designs.

Here's the for-sure-I-need-this list of skills I'm looking for:

[x] Proficient in modern HTML and CSS. Proficient as in good HTML structure patterns, using CSS3 with pre- or post-processors, etc.
[x] Has a solid handle on jQuery and vanilla JS, and when it's appropriate to use either.
[x] Can tastefully convert existing designs and concepts into working webpages
[x] Has a working knowledge of task automation ([Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)) and git.
[x] Has experience working with Wordpress themes
[x] Has a working knowledge of PHP

And the things that would really seal the deal:

[x] A solid PHP developer with experience building web apps
[x] Has experience working with [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) or similar PHP frameworks
[x] Has experience working with LemonStand (basically like a WP theme, but with Twig)
