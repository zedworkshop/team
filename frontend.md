### Hello!

##### I'm looking for a friendly, solid front-end developer in the Huntsville, Alabama area to help me with some small projects now, with the potential of joining me on larger projects later.

Currently, projects involve creating and implementing [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) and [LemonStand](http://lemonstand.com) themes out of existing designs.

###### Here's the for-sure-I-need-this list of skills I'm looking for:

- [x] Proficient in modern HTML and CSS. "Proficient" as in solid HTML structure patterns, uses CSS3 with pre- or post-processors, etc.
- [x] Has a solid handle on jQuery and vanilla JS, and when it's appropriate to use either.
- [x] Can tastefully convert existing designs and concepts into working webpages
- [x] Has a working knowledge of task automation ([Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)) and git.
- [x] Has experience working with Wordpress themes
- [x] Has a working knowledge of PHP

###### And the things that would really seal the deal:

- [ ] A solid PHP developer with experience building web apps
- [ ] Has experience working with [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) or similar PHP frameworks

###### Finally, some experience points:
